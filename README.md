# Zola Demo

This repository was built to showcase the results of the instructions in a [series of posts](https://tandiljuan.github.io/en/series/zola-step-by-step/) about learning the [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) static site generator. The resulting site can be found [here](https://tandiljuan.github.io/zola-demo/).

You can read the posts or follow the commits in this repository to learn how to create a simple static site and publish it online from the ground up.

Please note that the steps provided are quite opinionated. The aim is to offer a simple reference to help you understand how everything works. However, there are many other approaches, likely better ones, that can achieve the same result.

I hope this helps you on your journey.

Take care and have a great day!
